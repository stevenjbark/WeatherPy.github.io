File: index.html
Multiple attempts to make the panel more responsive in the intermediate range of screen resolutions were not successful.

File: index2.html
Using an alternative approach proved to be more responsive to page resolutions from large to small, but did not use a secondary
box or panel. I have included this as index2.html. Cloning the repository to your local computer and using index2.html to replace
index.html shows this alternative approach to the index page.
